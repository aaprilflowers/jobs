# Senior iOS Engineer

We are working on an open-source, end-to-end encrypted, JS-scriptable messaging platform in the spirit of the web. We are early contributors to Firefox and Chrome, Netflix and Yelp. We've built and shipped browsers to billions of people and have scaled backend services as large as Google Search. We believe that an open approach to a communication platform is a better future than where just one or two companies control how we talk and share information—we shouldn't have to just sit idly hoping that Facebook will combat fake news while at the same time it builds censorship tools for China.  

Imagine if you could rip out retweet from Twitter and replace it with something else in a couple lines of Javascript. Or find a community you like, view-source, and fork its underlying code.  

We are looking for an iOS developer responsible for the development and maintenance of applications aimed at a range of iOS devices including mobile phones and tablet computers. Your primary focus will be development of iOS applications and their integration with back-end services. You will be working alongside other engineers and developers working on different layers of the infrastructure. Therefore, a commitment to collaborative problem solving, sophisticated design, and the creation of quality products is essential.

We work mostly distributed around the Bay Area. We are nearing the end of our alpha. Now is the perfect time to join us :)
