## Overview
An early-stage stealth startup building a really interesting product called Other Chat. t's an open-source, scriptable/hackable messaging platform with end-to-end encryption. Think Slack, but for friends as opposed to for companies, and highly extensible and customizable. This description does not do it justice, but it's the best I have for now.

The founding team is a group of talented industry heavyweights from companies like Jawbone, Mozilla, Netflix, and Google. Pretty much everyone there is highly technical and
accomplished:

We are working on an open-source, end-to-end encrypted, JS-scriptable messaging platform in the spirit of the web. We are early contributors to Firefox and Chrome, Netflix and Yelp. We've built and shipped browsers to billions of people and have scaled backend services as large as Google Search. We believe that an open approach to a communication platform is a better future than where just one or two companies control how we talk and share informationâ€”we shouldn't have to just sit idly hoping that Facebook will combat fake news while at the same time it builds censorship tools for China.

Imagine if you could rip out retweet from Twitter and replace it with something else in a couple lines of Javascript. Or find a community you like, view-source, and fork its underlying code.

We work mostly distributedly around the Bay Area. We are nearing the end of our alpha. Now is the perfect time to join us :)
