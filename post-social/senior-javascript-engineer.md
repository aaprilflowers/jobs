# Senior Javascript Engineer
### San Francisco, CA

## Overview
We are working on an open-source, end-to-end encrypted, JS-scriptable messaging platform in the spirit of the web. We are early contributors to Firefox and Chrome, Netflix and Yelp. We've built and shipped browsers to billions of people and have scaled backend services as large as Google Search. We believe that an open approach to a communication platform is a better future than where just one or two companies control how we talk and share informationâ€”we shouldn't have to just sit idly hoping that Facebook will combat fake news while at the same time it builds censorship tools for China.  

Imagine if you could rip out retweet from Twitter and replace it with something else in a couple lines of Javascript. Or find a community you like, view-source, and fork its underlying code.  

We are looking for a great JavaScript developer who is proficient with React/Redux. Your primary focus will be on developing our web client and contributing to our developer tools. You will ensure that these components and the overall application are robust and easy to maintain. You will coordinate with the rest of the team working on different layers of the infrastructure. Therefore, a commitment to collaborative problem solving, sophisticated design, and quality product is important.

We work mostly distributed around the Bay Area. We are nearing the end of our alpha. Now is the perfect time to join us :)
