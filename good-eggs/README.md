# GoodEggs

## Overview
Good Eggs makes it easier for people to buy organic foods produced by independent farmers and other local food vendors. Think Instacart, but locally sourced organic and sustainable. Customers can shop online for nearby farms and vendors, then Good Eggs handles packaging those orders and delivering them. They are in a re-founding process so great opportunity to join and have a significant impact on their future success.
