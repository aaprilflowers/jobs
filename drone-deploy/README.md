# DroneDeploy

## Overview
DroneDeploy is a Series B ($31M total) software startup in SF that puts drones to work. Flight paths are generated automatically and images are processed in real-time to generate high-res 3d maps and other actionable insights mid-flight. With only 7 engineers on staff, every technical hire will have a significant impact in unlocking the power of drones for farmers, miners and a broad spectrum of commercial applications.
