# Cruise

## Overview
Our first production run will be limited to 50 units, and you get first access.  We’ve also allotted a few units from our initial supply for friends of friends.  The products sold now will be installed at the beginning of 2015 and are being pre-sold on a first come first serve basis.  9 of the 50 are already spoken for, so let me know soon if you’re interested.

RP-1
The RP-1 is the first highway autopilot that installs onto your car.  It uses advanced machine vision and radar technology to keep your car in its lane and control your speed, while you sit back and enjoy the ride.  The RP-1 completely takes the pain out of commuting, stop-and-go traffic, and long trips.  And it looks pretty cool.

Works on 2012 or newer Audi A4/S4.
Works only in California for now.
Cost: $10k

?UPDATE: The RP-1 isn't the focus anymore... they are working on city driving cars, thus making the next step to fully autonomous cars.

Cruise is located in SoMa and the team currently consists of four people. These folks are responsible for everything from writing code to actually building and installing the physical hardware (hiring focus on the software side currently -- lots of Python & C++; ROS). Founder Kyle Vogt is fairly well known from his work with Justin.TV, Stitch, and Socialcam.

I visited their office (which is actually a garage) on Tuesday and they had their computers plugged directly into the cars as they were writing code. They have a working prototype and videos of how the current version works for highway driving.

Their product (current prototype) is an aftermarket system that is built to work with the cars we all drive today. This at least slightly differentiates them from the majority of the major players in a similar space (Google, BMW, Mercedes, etc.). Additionally, they believe that their lean / scrappy startup mentality will aid them in the quest to beat the others to market.

Technical skills aside, the ideal hire is someone who is comfortable trading a high salary for high equity. The next few hires will receive around 1% equity (more or less depending on salary requirements). I would imagine that for the right person all of this will be negotiable.
