# Cruise

## Overview
Cruise is the scrappy company competing (and arguably winning) in the autonomous car race against the likes of Google, Tesla and Bosch. Cruise was founded by Kyle Vogt who you may recognize from his previous ventures: Twitch (sold to Amazon for $1B), Justin.TV & SocialCam. They were just sold to GM in a lucrative deal, and are a strategic piece in the race to the first fully autonomous car.  Their world-class engineering team mastered autonomous highway driving in just a few months and have already shipped a product. With GM staying out of the way, and the money in the bag, Cruise is geared up to take the lead in the race to the first fully autonomous car!
