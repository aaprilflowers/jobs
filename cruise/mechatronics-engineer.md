## Mechatronics Engineer
#### San Francisco, CA

### Quick Summary
We're the driverless car company. We believe in building great products to improve lives and prevent car accidents. Our first product is a Highway Autopilot that can be installed on almost any car. It uses an array of sensors and actuators to safely navigate along the highway. To use it, just drive into a lane on the highway and push a button. Our team is small, but we move quickly. In less than a year, we've built prototype vehicles that have logged thousands of autonomous miles on California highways. We're looking for smart, ambitious people to help develop our core technology, ensure it's reliable and safe, and bring it to production quality. We're looking for a talented Mechatronics Engineer to design, prototype, and test various drive-by-wire actuation systems and components for retrofit on existing vehicles.
