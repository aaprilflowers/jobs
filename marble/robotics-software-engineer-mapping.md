# Robotics Software Engineer - Mapping
### San Francisco, CA

## Quick Summary
We are a scrappy early-stage robotics startup based in San Francisco. We design, build, and operate autonomous urban delivery robots. In San Francisco alone, hundreds of thousands of packages are delivered every day. Over half of the world’s population lives in cities at least this big. Robotic delivery will improve reliability and drastically reduce the cost of delivery, touching the lives of billions of people and ultimately transforming how the world works. Our team is small and we’re moving lightning fast to create the world’s first fleet of autonomous delivery robots to solve this Earth-scale problem.

## Job Description
City-scale mapping and map annotation is a core challenge for any robotic system operating in a city. In order to navigate from pick-up to drop-off a robot needs to know where it is and where to go. Maps give robots the knowledge required to perform these navigation tasks. Building navigation-quality maps on the scale of a city is a challenging SLAM problem. We are looking for a mapping lead who can build the tools needed to collect and process data from camera, LIDAR, and RADAR to build and update maps of the cities where we will operate. These maps will enable path planning and localization, and serve as the core of the perception system.
