# Haus

## Overview
Not just one of the housing search apps, Haus is the industry-first platform entirely focusing on 'selling&buying' process with fully transparency and immediacy for all the parties. It digitizes the entire housing purchase experience, letting sellers put their listing on the platform, where buyers and their agents can both post their offers and see an anonymous version of other offers that have been made on the listing.
