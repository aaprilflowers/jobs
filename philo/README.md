# Philo ðŸ“ºðŸŽ“

## Overview
The average American watches 4.5 hours of TV a day, and cable is the biggest advertising market in the world. It's about time someone created a better user experience. Philo is reinventing TV, starting with universities and small cable providers. With founders coming from Harvard, a CTO from MIT, one of Facebook's founding level engineers as CEO, and an extremely talented engineering team, they are beginning their journey to become like Spotify for your TV.

## Culture and Values
#### Necessity is the mother of invention
Philo was born in a Harvard dorm room, where cable TV wasnâ€™t offered and the over-the-air broadcast couldnâ€™t penetrate the walls of the 300-year-old brick residence halls. The founders of Philo wanted to watch TV around campus, so they wrapped their room in aluminum foil to boost the signal, and connected it to a server to stream it over the campus network.

#### Weâ€™ve moved from aluminum foil to silicon
Our technology may have changed, but our mission is the same. At Philo, we are building the TV experience we wanted for ourselves. Today, hundreds of thousands of students can use Philo to watch all the live and recorded television they love on all of their favorite devices, and thatâ€™s just the beginning.

#### Company and Culture
Weâ€™re a small team that puts our product experience first. We foster a flexible work environment that is supportive but allows for autonomy so that everyone on the team can help us build towards our vision. Philo engineers own what they build from start to finish. We ship to production multiple times per day and keep unnecessary process to a minimum so we can maintain our pace of rapid development. We value pragmatism, having pride in our work, and deep transparency at all levels.

#### Hack the Full Stack
Philoâ€™s engineers hack up and down the technology stack. Itâ€™s not uncommon for a Philo engineer to go from backend coding to user experience design, from the video encoding pipeline to system scalability, from site maintenance to iOS/Android development.
