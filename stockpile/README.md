# Stockpile üí∞üéÅ

## Overview
Introducing the world‚Äôs first gift card for stock! For the first time ever, you can buy $25, $50, and $100 Stockpile gift cards off the gift card rack at stores like OfficeMax, K-Mart, Safeway, and ToysRUs, or send e-gifts up to $1000 from our website (stockpile.com) or mobile app. You can also buy fractional shares of stock for yourself, and soon, you‚Äôll be able to redeem rewards points for stock and much more!

Stockpile‚Äôs mission is to democratize stock ownership. 86% of the population has never had a chance to own stock because it‚Äôs intimidating and expensive, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way! We‚Äôve broken down the barriers to stock ownership by building our own fractional shares platform and partnering with Fortune 500 companies to bring the stock market to you, whether you‚Äôre grocery shopping or doing your mobile banking. We‚Äôre also partnering with nonprofits to promote financial literacy and empowerment so anyone around the world, of any age or income level, can invest for their future.
