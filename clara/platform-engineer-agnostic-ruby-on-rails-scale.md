## Platform Engineer
#### San Francisco, CA

### Quick Summary
Based in Downtown San Francisco, we’re a venture capital backed company that has drawn top talent from Silicon Valley, financial services, the federal government and the mortgage industry. Being a platform engineer here can be very different than at other companies. Our team is united by a fundamental curiosity about how technology can change an industry and improve a pain point in many people’s lives. We tackle some of the same technical challenges you might find elsewhere -- scalability, security, and reliability -- but we also face a highly complex and extremely broad domain that we need to understand, apply new thinking to, and build software for. This calls for engineers who have a desire to learn about, improve, and systematize every stage of a currently antiquated and inefficient process.

### Job Description
+	Build a reliable, performant, scalable, mutable platform for processing mortgages to automate and orchestrate a manual, slow, error-prone process.
+	Own the entire process from ideation and requirements to shipping to production
+	Deliver solutions to complex problems and high level goals, not boring specs
+	Bring an engineering approach to our product; the approach brings systemization and standardization of mortgages and is similar to what engineers already do with code
+	Learn, discover and grow. Become the best version of yourself and do the best work of your career
+	Improve everything you touch: Kill dead code, invent better tools, engender better coding practices

### Qualifications
+	Able to think in a structured, organized, and conceptual way - you can tell what one of those is, and can explain and taxonimize concepts
+	Unafraid of ambiguity and can navigate uncertain or open ended problems and circumstances
+	Know CS fundamentals, including algorithms and data structures - most importantly, know when it is and isn’t important to worry about them
+	Deep knowledge of some stack, ideally both a popular statically typed and a popular dynamically typed language. (Our stack is primarily Ruby on Rails, Postgres, Scala, living on AWS)
+	Love building systems - complex pieces of technology that work together to solve something
+	Experience with infrastructural, foundational technology - you know what a message bus is (and isn’t!) used for, you know how to manage, instrument and debug complex systems at scale
+	Experience with modelling complex business domain - near prescience for knowing where change will come from and building for it
+	Get stuff done - don’t waste time quibbling over trivialities
+	Ideally, an MSc in CompSci or similar engineering background. Of course, talented developers come from all different backgrounds, so we’re interested in hearing your unique story!
