## Lead Backend Engineer
#### San Francisco, CA

### Who we are:
Founded in 2009 and located in San Francisco’s South of Market neighborhood, our company is a small collective of food lovers and engineers with decades of robotics and restaurant experience. In the past five-plus years, we’ve solved many difficult engineering and manufacturing challenges, helped each other grow, and built some interesting intellectual property.

Our first device makes gourmet burgers from scratch. Not only do we literally grind the meat to order, we also slice tomatoes, onions, pickles, and a brioche roll fresh for you. Accented by an infinitely personalizable variety of produce, seasonings, and sauces, you can get exactly what you’re craving.
Serving a burger this great at such affordable prices would be impossible without culinary automation. We’re building an engineering-focused group of analytic and creative individuals. The team consists of roboticists from institutions including Berkeley and Stanford and firms like Tesla and NASA. Our culinary team contains veterans of  Chez Panisse and Fat Duck. Our advisors include experts across fields like engineering, culinary, design, intellectual property, and even a NRN Restaurant Operator of the Year Award winner. Additionally, we’re further advised and supported by some of the top investors in the Silicon Valley.

We are the team that connects machines to guest experience, working on cloud applications one day and mechatronics the next. We are highly cross-functional and adept learners. We bring robotics to life and delight to our guests.

### You are:
+	An experienced backend developer: You dig python because it’s an awesome language, you’re familiar with a backend framework like Django, you know your way around AWS or Heroku, and you’re not afraid of front-end development. You also know how to make Linux work for you.
+	Autonomous: You take initiative and pitch in where it helps the most. You play well with software developers but will go solo when necessary. You carve your own path and are driven to do your best. You also communicate well (with humans).
+	User-oriented: You design for the user above all else.
+	Product-minded: You influence product direction, gather and prioritize requirements, and keep up-to-date on market trends. You keep product true to its vision.

### You will:
+	Develop application backends: you create and administer services in AWS, Heroku or similar. You have a deep understanding of security, scalability and reliability. You care about SQL vs. NoSQL, but not that much.
+	Author APIs: you write, version and deploy APIs for machines and backends, for internal and external consumption. You use clear, action-based language. You anticipate needs and future-proof. You’re proud when someone compares your API to one of the great APIs (and you have a few thoughts on which APIs are great).

### You might also:
+	Create delightful user interfaces: you create delightful and easy-to-use interfaces for consumer and retail applications. You use the latest web or native technologies to prototype and test rapidly.
+	Create product requirement documents: you identify stakeholders, gather product requirements and triage.
+	Set product roadmaps: you define MVP and milestones and coordinate cross-functional teams. The development team likes you.
+	Manage third-party development partners: you pick good partners and build long-lasting relationships. You hold feet to the fire and give feedback to keep development on-track.
