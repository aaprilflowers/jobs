## Android Engineer
#### San Francisco, CA

### Quick Summary
We’re looking for an Android engineer to take substantial ownership of our Android app. You'll need to have 2-4 years of prior experience working on Android development, and ideally you'll also have interest in owning full-stack feature development on Android (which probably means writing some Python end points as well). Likewise, the ideal candidate has a degree in CS or related field.  Our Android app is going to be our next big platform - especially as Chromebooks, increasingly used by more and more school districts across the world, switch to using native apps instead of websites, and you'll have the opportunity to own major parts of our product.

### About Us
+	We're a small team, so you get to touch a lot of things. iOS, Android, Angular, Python, DynamoDB, AWS. It’s a great opportunity to learn and own big parts of a product.
+	In almost every role we’re figuring out how to operate at scale - whether it’s figuring out our engineering processes or sales approach, you’ll have the opportunity to impact our culture and how the company works.
+	We are well funded and have an experienced team. You'll work side by side with creators & leads of some products you know - Google Calendar, Picasa, Google Groups, Google Maps, Facebook Platform.
+	We pride ourselves on a work environment that balances work & life. We want people to be excited about what they are working on and always learning.
+	We have an unlimited vacation policy & take a company trip somewhere fun if we hit our goals. We’ve been to Taiwan and Japan and are working on plans for this year.
+	Free lunch!
