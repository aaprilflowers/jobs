### Why choose us?
In 2011, the founding team spent six months in America’s unemployment lines to understand exactly why it is so hard to get hired and advance one’s career. They concluded that the skills gap is an information gap and set out to solve it.

LearnUp went on to build a training platform to help entry-level job seekers get hired. Today, they work closely with some of the largest employers in the U.S., including Gap Inc, AT&T and Dick’s Sporting Goods, to offer customized training to job applicants at these companies. Using LearnUp not only triples an applicant’s chances of getting hired, but hired workers empowered through LearnUp perform better and stay longer than their untrained counterparts.

In addition to focusing on the hiring process, LearnUp is now developing new career management tools to drive retention and career advancement. The team is building a large-scale virtual career coaching system to help new employees resolve common issues and move up the ladder to the next position. LearnUp’s vision is to amplify the tool with artificial intelligence and create an upward mobility platform that can support millions of workers and drive economic growth.
