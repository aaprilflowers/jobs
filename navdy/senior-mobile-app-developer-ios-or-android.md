## Senior Mobile App Developer (iOS or Android)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Quick Summary
This company creates a Head-Up Display (HUD) for your car. It connects to your phone and lets you use all the apps you love while keeping your eyes on the road. It sits on your dash and works in the car you already have.

You love writing beautiful functional apps for a living. You’re part engineer, part visual artist, part interaction designer. The apps run on iOS and Android phones. They also run on the HUD itself, which runs a version of Android. We have as many designers on staff as we have software developers. But we’re looking for software developers who could build beautifully designed apps without help from our designers.

### Required Skills
+	4+ years experience in either iOS or Android. Deep knowledge of your platform of choice, so you can bend it to your will.
+	Deep knowledge of Java or Objective-C, whatever the tools of your craft are.
+	A portfolio of 2 or more great apps. They don’t need to be popular. They just need to be great.
