# Infrastructure Software Engineer
### San Francisco, CA

## Overview:
The company was founded to make a transformative impact by delivering on the promise of applying technology to drive a smarter, more sustainable food supply. Through the use of food and sensory science to guide the creation of better food, and software and data science to engineer a new type of fast food experience, we are expanding the prominence and accessibility of an alternative that is better for people and better for the planet.

Our growing team of food scientists, software engineers, and industrial designers is located near the ballpark in the Soma. Our engineers each take substantial ownership over the features they develop, from requirements gathering, to design and implementation, to production deployment. They also collaborate closely with other engineers to brainstorm about design ideas and make sure that their systems work well together.

## The Job:
+ Contribute to the development of our Ruby-based management infrastructure.
+ Contribute to the development of our consumer-facing web experience and in-store automation.
+ Explore data systems that allow us to store and extract meaning from the food science and customer feedback that we generate.
+ Work with UI designers, product managers, and other engineers to turn mockups and requirements into reality.
+ Be an advocate for quality as a technologist and as a user.
+ Be a jack-of-all-trades who can jump into new problems and quickly deliver results.

## Requirements:
+ B.S. in Computer Science or equivalent experience. We are less interested in how many years of experience you have than the great work you've done.
+ You enjoy the green-field possibilities that an early stage start-up provides and you have the drive to discover what these possibilities are.
+ You have examples of challenging software design projects and the ability to describe how they were accomplished.
+ Experience developing or working with complex internet-oriented systems, in particular those built around RESTful web service APIs.
+ You are familiar with modern web application development, based in Ruby, Python, Java, Node.js, or the like.

## Bonuses:
+ You have previous start-up experience.
+ You have experience writing beautiful HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
