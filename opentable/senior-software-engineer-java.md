###Job Description
You would be part of a brand new team with a charter to build a machine learning based platform that helps restaurants attract diners by combining personalization, an auction driven ad bidding  engine, and self-serve campaign building tools.

Today restaurants spend over $12 billion each year on advertising in North America, with little ability to track the performance and value of these campaigns. This platform will change the status quo by allowing OpenTable’s network of over 30,000 restaurants to influence the  20 million+ diners who collectively spend over $10 billion at our restaurants each year.

We build core services on the JVM using Java. Web backends and simple middleware services are often made with NodeJS. Data is stored in PostgreSQL. Services are tied together with RESTful HTTP, RabbitMQ and Kafka. We run a Mesos cluster for large-scale, distributed applications. Hosting is in AWS and the data center.

The Team is cross-functional, co-located with product, design and delivery management. We use agile methods, deliver often and iterate quickly.
