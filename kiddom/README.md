# Kiddom

## Overview
Kiddom is a fun, dynamic and motivated team looking to bring real change to the lives of teachers, their students and the future of education. They are making software for K-12 educators by building a system that integrates all content curriculum, data and analytics into one coherent platform. This system will also collect classroom data, which has never been done before. Kiddom is growing at an impressive rate of 7% week over week and just raised a Series A round in June 2016 for $5M led by Khosla Ventures with Vinod Khosla and Keith Rabois on the Board. Vinod has called Kiddom his “favorite investment of the year” and has pushed out others to become the sole investors for this education company.
