# Chrous

## Overview
Chorus is using AI and NLP to create conversation intelligence for sales teams. They have a R&D team in Tel Aviv that has built this proprietary technology to give real time insights on sales calls to help close faster.  

Before sales calls were just a black box with a few notes captured in the CRM, now calls can be recorded and transcribed as well as analyzed to mark key moments like pain points, competitor mentions.
