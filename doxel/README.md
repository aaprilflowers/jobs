# Doxel

## Overview
Doxel is putting drones, computer vision, and building construction together in a way that is redefining what is possible when preventing costly and dangerous mistakes in buildings!   
Their ability to autonomously compare real world construction to architectural plans and pinpoint issues is so good, their customers are willing to pay orders of magnitude more for their solution. In the construction market (a trillion dollar industry), this means they have something truly special; in computer vision theyâ€™re tackling very tough problems.   
Need more convincing? Their advisor, Dr. Silvio Savarese a leading mind in Computer Vision at Stanford and they meet with him regularly!
