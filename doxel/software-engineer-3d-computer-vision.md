## Software Engineer - 3D Computer Vision
### Menlo Park, CA

## Product
Human error in construction costs the world about $3 Trillion/yr and is largely responsible for over 50% of construction projects running over schedule.

Using 3D computer vision and deep learning, our software turns off the shelf sensors into error detection tools for construction projects - giving project managers superhuman powers to spot critical issues that they otherwise couldn't.

This significantly reduces costs, and more importantly reduces the risk of a project running over schedule. Since our alpha release this quarter, we've seen a 50x growth in deployments.

## The role
You would work on the core part of our product - our spatial analytics engine which is already being used by customers.

We're looking for engineers who have a great theoretical foundation in computer vision and get a kick from implementing algorithms that can spot what the human eye can't!

## How you'll make an impact:
+ Develop 3D object classification algorithms using point cloud and RGB data
+ Implement algorithms using geometric techniques augmented by CNNs
+ Benchmark algorithms based on speed, accuracy and robustness to occlusion
+ Make critical architecture decisions based on benchmarking results
+ Work directly with customers to understand product requirements and make intuitive decisions based on the tradeoff between what customers want and what's possible with technology

## Great skills for this role:
+ Strong experience with 2D computer vision and 3D computer vision
+ Strong experience with C++ and Python
+ Experience with multi threaded applications
+ Experience with PCL and OpenCV
+ Bleeding edge knowledge of current research and ability to comprehend relevant publications
+ Strong math background
+ Exposure to CNNs

## Bonus:
+ Experience with CUDA
+ Comfortable with ROS

## Why us?
Much too often, we find companies that apply old technologies in new ways. Sure, that's valuable - but it's not exciting.

At our company, you will have the opportunity to make a significant contribution to the field of engineering *and* transform a $9 Trillion industry.

+ We're funded and advised by some of the best in Silicon Valley
+ You'd be getting in on the ground floor of a company that's taking off
+ We're a small team and you'd be able to make a major contribution to the company culture
+ You'll have a lot of autonomy in making engineering decisions
+ You'll have the opportunity to work alongside some of the smartest engineers in this space
....and of course we offer full health and dental benefits, all the food you can eat and the company of folks who are emotionally driven to apply computer vision to real world challenges.
